<h1>Why?</h1>
<p>You might ask "Why another language?".</p>
<p>I, of all people, would use an existing language for what I'm trying to do if possible.</p>
<p>So far I've tried several dozens of languages and none come even close to all of the following goals:</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<ol>
<li>Exploratory Programming: get results as soon as you ask, the "ask questions, get answers" property, a read-eval-print loop.</li>
<li>Higher-order Programming: if I have to write another "<span class="pre">for</span>" loop, I'm going to scream.</li>
<li>Numeric Tower: if using numbers, have them behave as in ordinary mathematics (the one everyone on the planet learns in high school) as far as possible.</li>
<li>Reflectiveness: Allow finding out of what exists by asking the system.</li>
<li>Simplicity: as simple as possible but no simpler (this means that there are few basic parts where each part is simple).</li>
<li>Referential Transparency: Replacing a symbol by its definition may not change the meaning of the program.</li>
</ol>
<p>(Haskell misses [1 3 4], it's closer than any other language)</p>
<h2>Non-Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>Low-level Systems Programming: I don't care about word size, manual memory management, memory mapped I/O, latches, Memory Barriers, ... . Neither does the language.</li>
<li>Speed: No, this language doesn't need to be faster than C.</li>
</ul>
<h1>What?</h1>
<p>So far, there exist:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="http://www.scratchpost.org/software/5D/spec/">5D Language Specification</a></li>
<li>an interpreter for the language, see the <a href="user/manual/index.html">5D User Manual</a> for how to run the interpreter.</li>
<li>documentation:<br/>
For how to use the language, see <a href="programming/tutorial/index.html">5D Tutorial</a> and <a href="programming/manual/index.html">5D Programming Manual</a>.<br/>
For how to use the standard libraries, see <a href="lib/">5D Library Documentation</a>.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
