<h1>5D Tutorial</h1>
<h2>Syntax Elements</h2>
<p>Names can contain every printable character except space and <span class="pre">#</span> and <span class="pre">@</span>, although operator names consist of different characters than other names.</p>
<p>Usually, operator names consist of funny characters or math operator characters, not alphanumeric letters.<!-- Custom operators have to be registered, giving them a precedence level, before they can be used.--></p>
<p>Some operators are preregistered (most important first):  
<span class="pre"
><span title="quotation (structured access)">.</span> 
 <span title="index">_</span> 
 <span title="index">^</span> 
 <span title="power">**</span>
 <span title="cross product">⨯</span>
 <span title="multiplication">*</span>
 <span title="multiplication">⋅</span> 
 <span title="division">/</span> 
 <span title="list element construction">:</span> 
 <span title="quotation">'</span> 
 <span title="list concatenation">++</span> 
 <span title="addition">+</span> 
 <span title="subtraction">-</span> 
 <span title="remainder determination">%</span> 
 <span title="equality test">=</span> 
 <span title="non-equality test">/=</span> 
 <span title="less-than test">&lt;</span> 
 <span title="less-than-or-equal test">&lt;=</span> 
 <span title="less-than-or-equal test">≤</span> 
 <span title="greater-than test">&gt;</span> 
 <span title="greater-than-or-equal test">&gt;=</span> 
 <span title="greater-than-or-equal test">≥</span> 
 <span title="logical and">&amp;&amp;</span> 
 <span title="logical or">||</span> 
 <span title="pair constructor">,</span> 
 <span title="function application">$</span>
 <span title="else">else</span>
 <span title="elif">elif</span>
 <span title="unix-like pipe">|</span> 
 <span title="either unit test expected result or comment">=&gt;</span>
 <span title="World time sequencer">;</span> 
 <span title="abstraction">\</span> 
 <span title="substitution">let</span> 
 <span title="substitution">import</span> 
 </span></p>
<!--<p>(<span class="pre">let</span> and <span class="pre">import</span> do not consist of funny characters because of tradition)</p>-->
<p>Monoms after a name are function arguments, like everywhere in mathematics: sin k⋅x=sin(k⋅x) and not <del>(sin k)*x</del>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, sin k⋅x+φ=(sin k⋅x)+φ</p>
<p>Likewise, 5⋅f x=(5⋅f) x and not <del>5⋅(f x)</del></p>

<h2>Programming by example</h2>
<h3>Hello world</h3>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/λ -i
let IO := requireModule "IO" in 
import [write! stdout] from IO in 
write! stdout "Hello world"
</pre>
<p>Note that you need to specify (using <span class="pre">-i</span>) that you want IO to happen (rather than just be described).</p>
<p>What this does is:</p>
<p><span class="pre">write! \file \text</span> will write text, once a World is given (i.e. by calling the interpreter with <span class="pre" title="world starter">-i</span> or chaining actions with <span class="pre" title="World time sequencer">;</span>).</p>

<h3>Mathematics</h3>
<p>The usual calculator mathematics work (note: no <span class="pre">-i</span>):</p>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/λ
let Arithmetic := requireModule "Arithmetic" in 
import [(+)] from Arithmetic in 
(5 + 2) =&gt; 7
</pre>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/λ
let Arithmetic := requireModule "Arithmetic" in 
import [(+) (⋅)] from Arithmetic in 
(5 + 2⋅3) =&gt; 11
</pre>
<p><a href="">Operator precedence</a> is as you would expect:</p>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/λ
let Arithmetic := requireModule "Arithmetic" in 
import [(+) (⋅)] from Arithmetic in 
(5 + 2⋅3) =&gt; 11
</pre>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/λ
let Arithmetic := requireModule "Arithmetic" in 
import [(+) (⋅)] from Arithmetic in 
let f := \x x⋅x in 
(5 + 2⋅(f 3)) =&gt; 23
</pre>
<p>Here, the function f is defined to be a function of x, giving the square of x.</p>
<p>Then the function f is evaluated with the argument 3.</p>
<p>However, there is one strange quirk: 2⋅f x means (2⋅f) x:</p>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/λ
let Arithmetic := requireModule "Arithmetic" in 
import [(+) (⋅)] from Arithmetic in 
let f := \x x⋅x in 
(5 + 2⋅f 3) =&gt; ???
</pre>
<p>The following works, too (although it has more parens for no reason):</p>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/λ
let Arithmetic := requireModule "Arithmetic" in 
import [(+) (⋅)] from Arithmetic in 
let f := \x x⋅x in 
(5 + 2⋅(f(3))) =&gt; 23
</pre>
<p>Or if it's the first operand of multiplication:</p>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/λ
let Arithmetic := requireModule "Arithmetic" in 
import [(+) (⋅)] from Arithmetic in 
let f := \x x⋅x in 
(5 + (f 3)⋅2) =&gt; 23
</pre>
<p>Note that <span class="pre">*</span> works for multiplication as well (and is the same thing):</p>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/λ
let Arithmetic := requireModule "Arithmetic" in 
import [(+) (*)] from Arithmetic in 
(5 + (f 3)*2) =&gt; 23
</pre>
<h3>Conditionals</h3>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/λ
let Arithmetic := requireModule "Arithmetic" in 
let Logic := requireModule "Logic" in 
let Composition := requireModule "Composition" in 
import [(≥)] from Arithmetic in 
import [(if) (else)] from Logic in 
import [($)] from Composition in 
let abs := \x if (x ≥ 0) x else (-x) in 
abs (-2) =&gt; 2
</pre>
<h3>Logical Operators and Logical Functions and Logical Values</h3>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/λ
let List := requireModule "List" in 
let Testers := requireModule "Testers" in 
let (=&gt;) := Testers.(=&gt;) in 
List.allTrue? [
#t =&gt; #t
#f =&gt; #t
#f &amp;&amp; #f    =&gt; #f
#f &amp;&amp; #t    =&gt; #f
#t &amp;&amp; #f    =&gt; #f
#t &amp;&amp; #t    =&gt; #t
#f || #f    =&gt; #f
#f || #t    =&gt; #t
#t || #t    =&gt; #t
#t || #t    =&gt; #t
not #f      =&gt; #t
not #t      =&gt; #f
]
</pre>
<!--
<p>There's a more traditional way, too:</p>
<pre>
REPL.import! "Composition"
REPL.defrec! 'f \x (f 1)      - endless recursion, but it works
</pre>
<p><span class="pre">defrec</span> is a macro which expands to the former. Note that <span class="pre">defrec</span> only works (usefully) for function definitions.</p>
-->
<h3>Lists</h3>
<p>The simplest form of list is the linked list.</p>
<p>Nodes of a linked list are created by <span class="pre" title="list constructor">:</span> like this:</p>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/λ
let List := requireModule "List" in 
import [(:) nil] from List in 
42:24:12:nil
</pre>
<p>This is a list with 3 elements, linked together through the tail. The last element has <span class="pre">nil</span> tail.</p>
<p>There's also a shorthand macro for creating lists used like this:</p>
<pre>
let List := requireModule "List" in 
import [(:) nil] from List in 
[42 24 12]
</pre>
<p>You can access elements like this:</p>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/λ
let List := requireModule "List" in 
import [(:) nil head tail cons? list? allTrue?] from List in 
allTrue? [
head (1:2:3:nil)            =&gt; 1
tail (1:2:3:nil)            =&gt; (2:3:nil)
head (tail (1:2:3:nil))     =&gt; 2
cons? (1:nil)               =&gt; #t
cons? nil                   =&gt; #f
cons? 42                    =&gt; #f
list? (1:nil)               =&gt; #t
list? nil                   =&gt; #t
]
</pre>

<h3>Literal Names</h3>
<p>Sometimes you want to <em>not</em> reduce a function or operator to their definition but rather leave the name. To do so, prefix their name by <span class="pre" title="quote">'</span></p>
<pre>
let x := 2 in 
'x =&gt; x
</pre>
<p>However:</p>
<pre>
let x := 2 in 
x =&gt; 2
</pre>

<h3>Keyword Arguments</h3>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/λ -i
REPL.import! "IO"
fopen @mode:"w" "foo.INI.temp"        -- Keyword Arguments need to be before normal arguments.
</pre>
<h3>Conditionals</h3>
<p>Conditionals are used for flow control. <!--Note that the result of a conditional is a Church functional.--></p>
<p>If you want to see a short result on screen, use something like the following:</p>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/λ
let Logic := requireModule "Logic" in 
let Testers := requireModule "Testers" in 
let (=&gt;) := Testers.(=&gt;) in 
if (#t &amp;&amp; #t) 'yes else 'no =&gt; 'yes
</pre>
<h3>I/O</h3>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/λ -i
let IO := requireModule "IO" in 
import [write! flush! readline! return! stdout] from IO in 
write! stdout "What's your name? " ;\_
flush! stdout ;\_
readline! stdin ;\name
write! stdout "Hello " ;\_
write! stdout name ;\_
flush! stdout ;\_
return! name
</pre>
<p>What this does is:</p>
<p><span class="pre">write! \file \text</span> will write text, once a World is given (i.e. by <span class="pre" title="world starter">interpreter option -i</span> or <span class="pre" title="World time sequencer">;</span>).</p>
<p><span class="pre">;</span> will sequence two operations so the left-hand-side operation will be done first and the result of that operation given to the right-hand-side - which results in an operation, which will be done afterwards.</p>
<p><span class="pre">_</span> is the traditional variable name for "don't care about the argument".</p>

<h3>Indentation</h3>
<p>If you want to spread your program over multiple lines, you can. However, then, indentation rules come into effect.</p>
<pre>
let Arithmetic := requireModule "Arithmetic" in 
let Logic := requireModule "Logic" in 
let Composition := requireModule "Composition" in 
import [(if) (else) (elif) (=)] from Logic in 
import [($)] from Composition in 
import [(=)] from Arithmetic in 
if (x = 0)
  1
elif (x = 1)
  2
elif (x = 2)
  3
else 
  4
</pre>
<p>These work as follows:</p>
<p>If the indentation (number of whitespace characters at the beginning of the line) increased compared to the previous line, then a "(" is inserted.</p>
<p>If the indentation decreased compared to the previous lines, then one or more ")" are inserted until previous blocks up to and excluding the current block are closed.</p>

<h3>Abbreviations</h3>

<h4>Single Abbreviation</h4>
<p>If you want to abbreviate some formula you use often, you can use the <span class="pre" title="let macro">let</span> macro.</p>
<p><span class="pre">let a := b in c</span> expands to <span class="pre">(\a c) b</span>, the macro argument order being more common for programmers.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
let pi := 3.141592 in 
2⋅pi
</pre>
<p>Result is:</p>
<pre>
6.283184
</pre>
<p>Because:</p>
<pre>
((\pi 2⋅pi) 3.141592) =&gt; 6.283184
</pre>

<h4>Mass Abbreviation</h4>
<p>If you want to abbreviate a lot of <span class="pre" title="let macro">let</span>s, you can use the <span class="pre" title="import macro">import</span> macro.</p>
<p><span class="pre">import [a b c d] from F in B</span> expands to:</p>
<pre>
let a := F.a in 
let b := F.b in 
let c := F.c in 
let d := F.d in 
B
</pre>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
let Arithmetic := requireModule "Arithmetic" in 
import [(+) (-) (*) (/)] from Arithmetic in 
5 + 2*3
</pre>

<h2>REPL</h2>
<p>The interactive interpreter has a few special features, available through the module "REPL" which is automatically imported for you and made available under the name <span class="pre">REPL</span>:</p>

<h3>REPL Environment Extension</h3>
<p>If you keep needing the same definitions all the time, you can add them to the environment of the REPL and have them available automatically in the future:</p>
<pre>
REPL.import! "IO"
</pre>
<p>Note that this will import <em>everything</em> from the module "IO", possibly overriding your own definitions of things of the same name.</p>

<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>Sometimes you want to know how a function was originally defined (as opposed to how it was actually implemented).</p>
<p>Therefore, the λ REPL has a command to retrieve the original definition of things in its environment:</p>
<p>Note that you need to put parenthesis around operators (in order to prevent them from asserting their own precedence).</p>
<pre>
REPL.import! "IO"
REPL.define! 'f \x x*x
REPL.describe! 'f =&gt; \x x*x
REPL.describe! '(;) =&gt; \m \ber \world (\r ber (ioValue r) (ioWorld r)) (m world)
</pre>
<p>If there are multiple overrides for the definition, try using @backOffset: to reach back. The value is an integer starting at 0 (which is the default) stating how many definitions (of <em>that</em> symbol) back you want to reach.</p>
<pre>
REPL.describe! @backOffset:1 'g =&gt; \x x*x
</pre>

<h3>Recursion</h3>
<p>Usually, the function name is <em>not</em> available within the function:</p>
<pre>
REPL.define! 'f (\x (f 1))      -- makes no sense
</pre>
<p>If you want it to do recursion, do it like this:</p>
<pre>
REPL.import! "Composition"
REPL.define! 'f (rec \f \x (f 1))      -- endless recursion, but it works
</pre>
<p>Or like this, which is exactly the same:</p>
<pre>
REPL.import! "Composition"
REPL.define! 'f (rec \self \x (self 1))      -- endless recursion, but it works
</pre>
<p>Note that the reason that <span class="pre">define! 'f</span> doesn't make f available within the body of f is that you can refer to previous definitions of f within the new definition of f.</p>
<p>An example will make that clearer:</p>
<pre>
REPL.import! "Logic"
REPL.import! "Arithmetic"
REPL.define! 'f \x (x**x)
REPL.define! 'f \x if (x = 0) 1 else (f x)    -- refers to the previous definition.
</pre>

<h3>Pairs</h3>
