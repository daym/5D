<h2>Syntax Elements</h2>
<p>Names can contain every printable character except space and <span class="pre">#</span> and <span class="pre">@</span>, although operator names consist of different characters than other names.</p>
<p>Operator names consist of funny characters or math operator characters, not alphanumeric letters. Custom operators have to be registered, giving them a precedence level, before they can be used.</p>
<p>Some are preregistered: <span class="pre"
><span title="index">_</span> 
 <span title="index">.</span> 
 <span title="index">^</span> 
 <span title="power">**</span>
 <span title="cross product">⨯</span>
 <span title="multiplication">*</span>
 <span title="multiplication">⋅</span> 
 <span title="division">/</span> 
 <span title="modulation">%</span> 
 <span title="list element construction">:</span> 
 <span title="list concatenation">++</span> 
 <span title="function application">$</span>
 <span title="addition">+</span> 
 <span title="subtraction">-</span> 
 <span title="equality test">=</span> 
 <span title="non-equality test">/=</span> 
 <span title="less-than test">&lt;</span> 
 <span title="less-than-or-equal test">&lt;=</span> 
 <span title="less-than-or-equal test">≤</span> 
 <span title="greater-than test">&gt;</span> 
 <span title="greater-than-or-equal test">&gt;=</span> 
 <span title="greater-than-or-equal test">≥</span> 
 <span title="logical and">&amp;&amp;</span> 
 <span title="logical or">||</span> 
 <span title="pair constructor">,</span> 
 <span title="World time sequencer">;</span> 
 <span title="unix-like pipe">|</span> 
 <span title="either unit test expected result or comment">=&gt;</span>
 </span></p>
<p>Monoms after a name are function arguments, like everywhere in mathematics: sin k⋅x=sin(k⋅x) and not <del>(sin k)*x</del>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, sin k⋅x+φ=(sin k⋅x)+φ</p>
<p>Likewise, 5⋅f x=(5⋅f) x and not <del>5⋅(f x)</del></p>

<h2>Programming by example</h2>
<h3>Hello world</h3>
<pre>
runIO (write stdout "Hello world")
</pre>
<p>What this does is:</p>
<p><span class="pre">runIO</span> wraps IO.</p>
<p><span class="pre">write \file \text</span> will write text, once a World is given (i.e. by <span class="pre" title="world starter">runIO</span> or <span class="pre" title="World time sequencer">;</span>).</p>

<h3>Mathematics</h3>
<p>The usual calculator mathematics work:</p>
<pre>
5 + 2 =&gt; 7
</pre>
<pre>
5 + 2⋅3 =&gt; 11
</pre>
<p><a href="">Operator precedence</a> is as you would expect, with one strange quirk: 2⋅f x means (2⋅f) x</p>
<pre>
5 + 2⋅3 =&gt; 11
</pre>
<pre>
define f \x x⋅x
5 + 2⋅(f 3) =&gt; 23
5 + 2⋅f 3 =&gt; ??????
</pre>
<p>Here, the function f is defined to be a function of x, giving the square of x.</p>
<p>Then the function f is called with the argument 3. The following works, too (although it has more parens for no reason):</p>
<pre>
define f\x x⋅x
5+2⋅(f(3)) =&gt; 23
</pre>
<p>Or if it's the first operand of multiplication:</p>
<pre>
define f \x x⋅x
5 + (f 3)⋅2 =&gt; 23
</pre>
<p>Note that <span class="pre">*</span> works for multiplication as well (and is the same thing):</p>
<pre>
define f \x x⋅x
5 + (f 3)*2 =&gt; 23
</pre>
<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>Sometimes you want to know how a function was originally defined (as opposed to how it was actually implemented).</p>
<p>Therefore, the REPL has a command to retrieve the original definition:</p>
<p>Note that you need to put parenthesis around operators (in order to prevent them from asserting their own precedence).</p>
<pre>
define f \x x*x
describe 'f =&gt; \x x*x
describe '(;) =&gt; \m \ber \world (\r ber (ioValue r) (ioWorld r)) (m world)
</pre>
<h3>Conditionals</h3>
<pre>
define abs \x if (x ≥ 0)  (x)
                          (-x)
</pre>
<h3>Logical Operators and Logical Functions and Logical Values</h3>
<pre>
#t
#f
#f &amp;&amp; #f    =&gt; #f
#f &amp;&amp; #t    =&gt; #f
#t &amp;&amp; #f    =&gt; #f
#t &amp;&amp; #t    =&gt; #t
#f || #f    =&gt; #f
#f || #t    =&gt; #t
#t || #t    =&gt; #t
#t || #t    =&gt; #t
not #f      =&gt; #t
not #t      =&gt; #f
</pre>
<h3>Recursion</h3>
<p>Usually, the function name is <em>not</em> available within the function:</p>
<pre>
define f \x (f 1)      -- makes no sense
</pre>
<p>If you want it to do recursion, do it like this:</p>
<pre>
define f rec \f \x (f 1)      -- endless recursion, but it works
</pre>
<p>Or like this, which is exactly the same:</p>
<pre>
define f rec \self \x (self 1)      -- endless recursion, but it works
</pre>
<p>There's a more traditional way, too:</p>
<pre>
defrec f \x (f 1)      -- endless recursion, but it works
</pre>
<p><span class="pre">defrec</span> is a macro which expands to the former. Note that <span class="pre">defrec</span> only works (usefully) for function definitions.</p>
<p>Note that the reason that <span class="pre">define f</span> doesn't make f available within the body of f is that you can refer to previous definitions of f within the new definition of f.</p>
<p>An example will make that clearer:</p>
<pre>
define f \x (x**x)
define f \x if (x = 0)   1
                         (f x)    -- refers to the one above.
</pre>
<h3>Lists</h3>
<p>The simplest form of list is the linked list.</p>
<p>Nodes of a linked list are created by <span class="pre" title="list constructor">:</span> like this:</p>
<pre>
42:24:12:nil
</pre>
<p>This is a list with 3 elements, linked together through the tail. The last element has <span class="pre">nil</span> tail.</p>
<pre>
head (1:2:3:nil)            =&gt; 1
tail (1:2:3:nil)            =&gt; (2:3:nil)
head (tail (1:2:3:nil))     =&gt; 2
cons? (1:nil)               =&gt; #t
cons? nil                   =&gt; #f
cons? 42                    =&gt; #f
list? (1:nil)               =&gt; #t
list? nil                   =&gt; #t
</pre>
<p>There's also a shorthand macro for creating lists used like this:</p>
<pre>
[42 24 12]
</pre>
<h3>Literal Names</h3>
<p>Sometimes you want to <em>not</em> reduce a function or operator to their definition but rather leave the name. To do so, prefix their name by <span class="pre">quote</span> or <span class="pre" title="quote">'</span></p>
<pre>
define x 2
x            =&gt; 2
quote x      =&gt; x       -- NOT 2
'x           =&gt; x       -- NOT 2
symbol? 'x   =&gt; #t
symbol? x    =&gt; #f
</pre>
<h3>Keyword Arguments</h3>
<pre>
fopen @mode:"w" "foo.INI.temp"        -- Keyword Arguments need to be before normal arguments.
</pre>
<h3>Conditionals</h3>
<p>Conditionals are used for flow control. Note that the result of a conditional is a Church functional.</p>
<p>If you want to see a short result on screen, use toBool. toBool converts a Chruch Boolean to either the symbol <span class="pre">t</span> or the symbol <span class="pre">f</span> after figuring out which is appropriate.</p>
<pre>
#t&amp;&amp;#t =&gt; \t \f (\t \f t) ((\t \f t) t f) f
toBool (#t&amp;&amp;#t) =&gt; t
#t&amp;&amp;#t | toBool =&gt; t
</pre>
<h3>I/O</h3>
<pre>
runIO
         write stdout "What's your name? " ;\_
         flush stdout ;\_
         readline stdIn ;\name
         write stdout "Hello " ;\_
         write stdout name ;\_
         flush stdout ;\_
         return name
</pre>
<p>What this does is:</p>
<p><span class="pre">runIO</span> wraps IO.</p>
<p><span class="pre">write \file \text</span> will write text, once a World is given (i.e. by <span class="pre" title="world starter">runIO</span> or <span class="pre" title="World time sequencer">;</span>).</p>
<p><span class="pre">;</span> will sequence two operations so the left-hand-side operation will be done first and the right-hand-side operation will be done afterwards.</p>
<p><span class="pre">_</span> is the traditional variable name for "don't care about the result".</p>
<p>Note that the parens have been left out and replaced by indentation.</p>

<h3>Indentation</h3>
<p>If you want to spread your programs over multiple lines, you can. However, then, indentation rules come into effect.</p>
<pre>
if (x = 0)
  1
$elif (x = 1)
  2
$elif (x = 2)
  3
$else 4
</pre>
<p>These work as follows:</p>
<p>If the indentation (number of whitespace characters at the beginning of the line) increased compared to the previous line, then a "(" is inserted.</p>
<p>If the indentation decreased compared to the previous lines, then one or more ")" are inserted until previous blocks up and excluding the current block are closed.</p>

<h3>Pairs</h3>
<p>Pairs are like lists, so pairs are probably not used that much.</p>
<pre>
1,2
first (1,2)    =&gt; 1
second (1,2)   =&gt; 2
first (1,2,3)    =&gt; 1
second (1,2,3)    =&gt; (2,3)
</pre>

define f $ x = f x
define (f . g) x = f (g x)
