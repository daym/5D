<h1>5D User Manual</h1>
<h2>REPL</h2>
<p>REPL is the Read-Eval-Print loop.</p>
<!-- TODO merge installation -->
<hr/>
<p>In order to get one, install 5D.</p>
<h3>Installation on UN*X</h3>
<p>Download the <span class="pre">5d_</span> deb file from <a href="http://www.scratchpost.org/software/5D/">5D Site</a> and install it using:</p>
<pre>
dpkg -i 5d_*_amd64.deb
</pre>
<p>(or whatever architecture you have instead of <em>amd64</em>).</p>
<p>You might also install some libraries, especially <span class="pre">5d-os</span> in order to be able to use basic OS functions (File IO etc) within the language.</p>
<p>You might also install LATEX, in order to get beautiful typesettings of 5D programs. Used are: <span class="pre">latex</span>, <span class="pre">dvips</span>, <span class="pre">convert</span>.</p>
<h3>Installation on Windows</h3>
<ol>
<li>Download <span class="pre">setup.exe</span> from <a href="http://www.scratchpost.org/software/5D/">5D Site</a> and install it like this:</li>
<li>Click <span class="pre">setup.exe</span></li>
</ol>
<p>You might also install some libraries, especially <span class="pre">5DLibs.exe</span> in order to be able to use basic OS functions (File IO etc) within the language.</p>
<h3>Installation on Nokia N900</h3>
<p>See Installation on UN*X. The architecture is <span class="pre">armel</span> .</p>
<h3>Installation on Amazon Kindle</h3>
<p>Download the <span class="pre">update_5D_</span> file from <a href="http://www.scratchpost.org/software/5D/">5D Site</a> and install it like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect your Kindle to the PC and copy the file onto it, into the root directory.</li>
<li>Eject the drive and disconnect your Kindle.</li>
<li>In the menu on the Kindle, select software update.</li>
<li>Click OK.</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<p>After installation, run one of the following:</p>
<table border="1">
<tr><th>Operating System</th><th>Program to Run</th></tr>
<tr><td>UN*X</td><td>5D (the GUI), T5D -i (the shell).</td></tr>
<tr><td>Windows</td><td>5D (the GUI), <del>T5D -i (the shell)</del>.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The T5D shell (in expression mode) looks like this:</p>

eval $ 
</pre>
<p>The T5D -i shell (in IO mode) looks like this:</p>
<pre>

runIO $ 
</pre>
<p>If you <em>actually</em> want to execute IO actions in order, use the IO mode. Otherwise, you can only <em>describe</em> IO actions.</p>
<p>By convention, IO actions are functions whose name ends with an exclamation mark (!).</p>
<hr/>
<p>In order to permanently import modules, use <span class="pre">REPL.import!</span>.</p>
<h2>REPL.import! "&lt;name&gt;"</h2>
<p><span class="pre">import!</span> will:</p>
<ul>
<li>ensure that the given module is loaded</li>
<li>import the symbols of the module that are on the whitelist and not on the blacklist into the current namespace (which is saved at the end).</li>
</ul>
<p>(In fact, <span class="pre">import!</span> is shorthand for a combination of <span class="pre">define!</span> (or <span class="pre">let</span>) and <span class="pre">requireModule</span>).</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
REPL.import! "Arithmetic"
</pre>
<hr/>
<p>In order to permanently define some variable in the environment, use <span class="pre">define!</span>.</p>
<h2>REPL.define! '&lt;name&gt; (&lt;body&gt;)"</h2>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
REPL.define! 'f (\x x*x)
return! (f 2) =&gt; 4
</pre>
<p>For non-permanent stuff, running T5D without -i is recommended, then you can leave off <span class="pre">return!</span> (permanently imported modules will be reloaded anyway).</p>
<h2>Future Work</h2>
<p>In the future, it is planned to remove all this strange business and instead just have the current expression include all imports (probably need better editing than <span class="pre">readline</span> for that, not sure).</p>
<p>Then, no permanent mode will be needed and no special config file which contains these permanent definitions.</p>
<p>IO mode will still be needed, not sure what to do about that.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
let Arithmetic := requireModule "Arithmetic" in 
import [(+) (-) (*) (/)] from Arithmetic in 
5 + 42
</pre>
</body>
