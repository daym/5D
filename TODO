eval $ runIO $ labs (-5.2)

loading modules (for example the one where errno! is in) causes errno to be clobbered.

= Builtin Types =

numbers: 1. Int (done), 2. Integer (done), 3. Q, 4. Float (done), 5. arbitrary-precision fixed point
^-- rounding, truncating.
equality (numbers, strings(?) and booleans (?) and symbols (?) and lists (?)) and non-equality.
Builtin ops: power
When printing builtin ops, revert to the symbol?
Complex number literals: #C(3.2 2)
Array literals: #(a b c)
subseq "Hello, World" 2 9
string-upcase
strcmp

= Data Structures =

sorting: quicksort (?), mergesort.
uniq
searching: binary search, bisect.
trees: binary trees, tries, red black trees.

= Error Handling =

... `catch` \e error e

= Pie-in-the-Sky =

bool builtins: move them into the runtime and somehow have the parser find them anyway (?)
move provide_dynamic_builtins into the reduce phase (?)
provide hooks for big integers (?)
provide callback used by the scanner for getting currently registered operators and their precedence
(+3) = \x (x+3)
#| commented out |#
make it possible to define custom operators in the REPL
function to join buffers (memoryview)
merge Str and Integer into one (for integer, the str() is reversed, though). (or merge Str and List into one)
move str() to the actual language
#'print or (function print) to get the value in the function slot.

= GUI =

GUI: allow deletion environment nodes (includes usage check in the rest of the environment).
GUI: allow moving of environment nodes.
GUI: allow compacting of environment nodes.
TUI: if trying to pass a path to a file that does not exist, it doesn't create it on exit. Should it?

= Beauty =

Math: indentation for 'if, 'rec, 'let, ';, ':  - don't forget nested ifs.
pattern-match a:b:c:nil back to the [] macro (this is already done for the Cons builtin but not if the Cons has not yet been built).
nested lists: line-break only for the second list if the first list is short enough.
pattern-match env entry back to the let macro.
setlocale(LC_ALL, "") without string conversion functions being idiots
Indentation:
	[(]    note how the auto) shouldn't close down yet - but it should close if we are back at the same paren level than we were before.
.. range
... range-with-unlimited-end
<=> compare

= Performance =

use hash table for dispatching FFI
performance optimisation: use the lowest bit to signify pointers (1=it is one). This will have problems with native pointers maybe, so also override the native allocator.
degrade from Integer to Int when possible.
$! strict applicator
make AST::Symbol const everywhere (best to introduce a Symbol_t or something)
maybe delay and force
tail recursion elimination.
cache numbers for some time?

= Parser =

--x
"# " as line comment starter (=> rem)
unary posfix operators like "!"?
readFromString "XYZ" -> (quoted) AST
eval AST userInitialEnvironment
add custom literal parsers

= Correctness =

Have the predicates check for non-SymbolReference non-quoted symbols or non-executed applications and if so, return "we can't do it"?
Floats only work to 3E38, it seems. What about higher numbers? (there's no such limit for 3E-999999)
It would be possible to make numbers like 3E3 mean 3000 and not 3000.0 - do we want that?
Reintroduce FALLBACK, i.e. tail [] shouldn't reduce.
If there are open parens, ignore indentation (note that this is the LEXER and so it technically can't distinguish between quoted or macro braces and actual braces).
sort exports
Just representing Str as a Integer would be a lot less weird and automatically allow comparisons to work as one would expect. However, it's unconventional. However, this would only be fast for little-endian architectures (as BigUnsigned Blks are ordered LSB first). Moreover, I don't think that Strings are manipulated that often.
add atomic? flag to allocateRecord and duplicateRecord.
use libffi (but: hello, Windows... sigh)
Either don't throw C++ exceptions or actually represent them somehow when one is thrown while reducing.
exception handling? ftp://ftp.cs.indiana.edu/pub/scheme-repository/doc/prop/exceptions.ss
NaN handling (ugh...)
put "describe" into module dispatcher.
make it possible to disable the searching for modules in the current directory!
ARM: support FPA10 floating-point accelerator (80 bit registers)
import: once importing a name which is already in the environment, auto-add a generic function?
module: once an unknown identifier is encountered, maybe auto-provide them to the importer so he can fill in what is needed.
(infixl 1 whatever)
\(**)
(fn? Builtins) should be true since a module can be used exactly like a function can (that it isn't is just an implementation detail!) - so RModule "are" functions.
allow building our own OperationPrecedenceList from within 5D.

move all the builtins into a .so file and load them via FFI.

fix Shunting Yard deque?
