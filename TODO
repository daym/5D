where does modulo fit in the precedence list?

= Macros = 

let a=b+c in ...
list comprehensions in []

= Parser =

1+2â‹… => error or partial application
--x
"# " as line comment starter (=> rem)
unary posfix operators like "!"?
There's max. 1 dot in a number, so stop if a second dot is encountered.
if there's a dot and then a non-number, backtrack, you've made a mistake.

= Builtin Types =

numbers: 1. Int (done), 2. Integer (done), 3. Q, 4. Float (done), 5. arbitrary-precision fixed point
equality (numbers, strings(?) and booleans (?) and symbols (?) and list (?))
Builtin ops: print braces?
Builtin ops: power

= FFI =

arrays?
translateFFI resulttype argtypes procedure => translator used when calling:
define libc fromLibrary "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6"
define writeProc libc 'write
define translateWrite translateFFI (\result ...) (\args ...)
define write translateWrite writeProc
fopen @mode:"w" "foo.INI.temp"

= Packages =

packages (namespaces)
import xyz hiding (a, b, c)
import xyz (a,b,c)
import qualified ...
import foo

= Data Structures =

sorting: quick sort, merge sort.
searching: binary search, bisect.
trees: binary trees, tries, red black trees.

= Error Handling =
... `catch` \e error e

= Pie-in-the-Sky =

bool builtins: move them into the runtime and somehow have the parser find them anyway (?)
move provide_dynamic_builtins into the reduce phase (?)
provide hooks for big integers (?)
provide callback used by the scanner for getting currently registered operators and their precedence
(+3) = \x (x+3)
ONLY implement marshallers and demarshallers in C, let them return stand-in buffers
#| commented out |#
make it possible to define custom operators in the REPL
function to join buffers (memoryview)
merge Str and Integer into one (for integer, the str() is reversed, though).
move str() to the actual language

= GUI =
GUI: allow deletion environment nodes (includes usage check in the rest of the environment).
GUI: allow moving of environment nodes.
GUI: allow compacting of environment nodes.
GUI: fix LATEX formatter again.
TUI: if trying to pass a path to a file that does not exist, it doesn't create it on exit. Should it?

= Beauty =

Math: indentation for 'if, 'rec, 'let, ';, ':
pattern-match a:b:c:nil back to the [] macro.
pattern-match env entry back to the let macro.

= Performance =

performance optimisation: use the lowest bit to signify pointers (1=it is one). This will have problems with native pointers maybe, so also override the native allocator.
degrade from Integer to Int when possible.
$! strict applicator
